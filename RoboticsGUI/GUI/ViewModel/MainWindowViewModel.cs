        /* Question: any issue with using 'static' in this case? Most of the variables in this window should technically only be created once...
         * Answer: Proper usage: probably only use static if this variable would be shared across all instances of MainWindowViewModel.
         * This consideration is probably true for the ArduinoModel, but not the TeamDataModel.  If we want to be technically correct,
         * we should probably make a MainWindowViewModel constructor so that the TeamDataModel and ArduinoModels can be properly 
         * instantiated in order. That said, there's no reason to have multiple MainWindows right now, so this distinction is currently 
         * not important. Static works as is right now because the static objects are created in order of declaration (non-static fields may be created in any order).
