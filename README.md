# Skybot Setup Instructions
1.  Install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2.  Download this repo
3.  Open Skybot\SkybotFirmata.ino in Arduino IDE.
4.  Select Arduino type, Board:Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560
5.  Select Arduino COM port (should be obvious)
6.  Upload to Arduino
7.  Wire LEDs and motors to Arduino (pins 22-30 currently have check boxes in the gui tied to them, make sure you plug in ground also.)
8.  Open RoboticsGUI\bin\Release\Robotics.exe . Arduino should begin blinking as program starts.
9.  Press check boxes to turn on and off LEDs or motors. Motors require two check boxes and will change direction if one is off and other is on.
